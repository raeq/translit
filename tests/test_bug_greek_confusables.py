"""Regression test: Greek and Cyrillic confusables follow TR39 *visual*
mappings, distinct from phonetic transliteration.

Greek Ρ (Rho, U+03A1) is visually identical to Latin P, but ``transliterate()``
maps it to R (phonetic). TR39 ``confusables.txt`` maps Ρ→P (visual), and
``normalize_confusables()`` follows that visual mapping. These tests guard that
phonetic-vs-visual distinction — and the ``strip_obfuscation()`` /
``security_clean()`` flows built on it — focusing on the historically confusing
characters: the lowercase homoglyphs and the combining-mark / case-corrected
prototypes locked in by #22. The exhaustive pair table is exercised separately
in ``test_confusables.py``; this file documents the *intent*.

Inputs use ``\\uXXXX`` escapes so the exact codepoint under test is unambiguous
in source review (the literal glyph appears in the description column).

    TR39 confusables.txt makes LATIN CAPITAL LETTER ESH (U+01A9) the *prototype*
    for the entire Sigma family (03A3, 2211, 2140, the math bold/italic sigmas,
    Tifinagh 2D49 all map to 01A9). Earlier — the #245 "Σ→esh oddity" —
    disarm returned that non-ASCII skeleton, on the theory that "neutralized
    (source removed) is the contract, not ASCII-folded".

    #341 reverses that contract: the non-ASCII Latin-extended prototypes fold to
    basic ASCII, and esh joins them. Sigma is phonetically 's' (and already
    transliterates to S), so the Σ→S spoof is now neutralized to plain
    ASCII instead of surviving as the confusing esh — which also leaked into
    the confusables-only ``security_clean`` preset. Capital sigmas fold to S
    (case-preserved); the caseless summation operators and Tifinagh fold to s.
    A *deliberate, documented* reversal of the #245 decision — exactly the
    explicit (not silent) change that pin asked for.
