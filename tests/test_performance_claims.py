"""Performance integrity claims relocated from docs/performance.md (#291).

``docs/performance.md`` presents its numbers as comparison tables only. The
executable proof that used to back those tables — the conservative ratio floors
and the fast-path guarantees — lives here, so the claims still self-verify in CI
instead of rotting in prose.

Two kinds of check, mirroring exactly what the doc-test blocks did:

* **Behavioural** (always run, disarm-only): the borrowed-``Cow`` ASCII identity
  fast path, ``batch == loop`` equivalence, and the documented example outputs.
  These ran unconditionally in the doc-test gate and keep doing so here.
* **Ratio floors** (run only where the pinned comparators from
  ``requirements/bench.txt`` are installed — ``perf-gate.yml`` and a local
  ``pip install -e .[bench]`` — and ``skip`` cleanly otherwise, exactly as the
  old blocks did via ``pytest.skip`` on ``ImportError``). The asserted floors are
  deliberately far looser than the published figures (~13–38×): a loose floor
  proves *direction and order of magnitude* on unknown, possibly loaded CI
  hardware without flaking, while the precise numbers live on the page and the
  ``perf-results`` branch.
