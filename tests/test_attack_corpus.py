"""Deterministic adversarial-attack regression (CI-gating).

This vendors compact generators for the Boucher et al. / *Fire Extinguishers*
attack taxonomy (homoglyph, zalgo, invisible, bidi, combined) and asserts
translit's defense pipelines recover the clean form, using the paper's
Exact Match Recovery (XMR) idea: for a defense pipeline ``P`` and a clean
string ``t``, ``P(attack(t)) == P(t)``.

Unlike ``test_security_invariants.py`` (Hypothesis, tier-2, worktree-only),
these are deterministic and run in the CI gate, so the security behavior is
guarded on every PR. Scope is intentionally the *bundled TR39* confusables;
out-of-scope classes (novel/non-TR39 homoglyphs, whole-script spoofs,
multi-character confusables) are documented in THREAT_MODEL.md and are not
asserted here.
