"""DEPRECATED: ``translit-rs`` has been renamed to ``disarm``.

Install and import ``disarm`` instead::

    pip install disarm
    import disarm

This 0.8.2 release is a thin compatibility shim: it depends on ``disarm`` and
re-exports its public API so existing ``import translit`` code keeps working
(with a :class:`DeprecationWarning`). The last functional release under the old
name was ``translit-rs 0.8.1``.

Rename notes (see https://github.com/raeq/disarm/issues/264):
  * ``TranslitError`` -> ``DisarmError`` (aliased below for back-compat).
  * the env var ``TRANSLIT_DICT_DIR`` -> ``DISARM_DICT_DIR``.
The transform API (``transliterate``, ``normalize``, ``slugify``, ...) is
unchanged.
