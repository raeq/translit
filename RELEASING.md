# Releasing translit

This document is the authoritative policy for **how translit is versioned** and **what
we do when a release turns out to be bad**. It is written for maintainers, but it is
public on purpose: downstream users should be able to predict exactly what a version
number means and what happens if a release has to be pulled.

It complements two neighbouring documents and does not repeat them:

- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — how to report a vulnerability privately, and the
  supported-version window.
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — the per-release record of what actually changed.
- [DEPENDENCY_UPGRADES.md](DEPENDENCY_UPGRADES.md) — the repeatable methodology for
  keeping dependencies current (soak windows, auto/manual lanes, verification depth).

## Versioning

translit version numbers use the familiar `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` shape, but the **major**
component does **not** carry the plain Semantic Versioning "incompatible API change"
meaning. We borrow the shape, not the major-version semantics. Within the `0.x` series
that we expect to occupy for a long time, the rules are:

### Patch / point release — `0.6.1`, `0.6.2`, `0.6.3` (a future `0.22.48`)

Three-component. The bucket for **bug fixes, cleanups, documentation improvements, and
other minor things**. A point release never introduces a new capability.

### Minor / feature release — `0.6`, `0.7`, `0.8` (a future `0.22`, `0.37`)

Two-component. The bucket for **new capabilities or major internal refactorings** — for
example, the extraction of a pure-Rust `translit-core` and its other-language bindings
is the `0.9` release.

Documentation that a feature **requires** ships **with** that feature, in the same minor
release — it is never split out into a separate point release. (Standalone documentation
improvements unattached to any feature still belong in a point release, per above.)

### Major — `1.0`, and `2.0`+

`1.0` is reached **only when a supported (paid) path exists**. The repository being public
does **not** imply `1.0`; this is a commercial-support milestone, not a launch milestone.
We will very likely stay below `1.0` for a long time, and that is by design.

`2.0` and later majors are cut **when support for the previous major expires**.

### No calendars

Milestones are buckets ordered by **scope and readiness, never by date**. We do not set
due dates on milestones, and we do not commit to release dates or ETAs. A milestone *is*
a release — "milestone" is just the planning-side name for the same thing.

> A note on the term "Semantic Versioning": [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) currently states
> versions follow SemVer. We follow SemVer's *format* and its patch/minor change
> discipline within `0.x`, but our **major**-version semantics are defined above
> (support status), not by API compatibility.

## Bad releases

A *bad release* is one that should not be used: a security vulnerability, data
corruption, a release that leaks secrets, a wrong or broken artifact, or a build that
will not install. This section defines exactly what we do.

### The core principle: you cannot un-ship

Every registry translit targets is **immutable or near-immutable** — once a version is
published, you can essentially never take it back cleanly. Deleting it is the *wrong*
tool: it breaks everyone who pinned that version, and on PyPI, crates.io, RubyGems, and
Maven Central you **still cannot reuse the version number** afterward, so you gain
nothing.

So a bad release is never deleted. It is **yanked**, **superseded** by a fresh point
release, and **announced**. Three rules follow:

1. **Never delete; yank or retract.** These are non-destructive "do not use this"
   signals, reversible where the registry supports it, and they preserve pinned users.
2. **Never reuse a version number.** A bad `0.6.3` is fixed by shipping `0.6.4` — never
   by re-cutting `0.6.3`.
3. **Yank immediately on confirmation — do not wait for the fix.** Yanking the bad
   version makes every resolver (pip, cargo, npm, …) fall back to the **previous
   non-yanked release**, which stays fully discoverable and installable. The only people
   affected are those who explicitly pinned `==<bad version>` — and they are exactly the
   ones who should see the signal. Waiting for the fix only prolongs exposure.
   - **Sole exception:** if the bad release is the *first-ever* release, there is no good
     version to fall back to — only then must the fix ship together with (or before) the
     yank.

### Severity → response

| Tier | Examples | Response |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Security vulnerability, data corruption, leaked secrets, wrong artifact uploaded | Yank immediately + superseding release ASAP. Issue a GHSA only if it meets the bar below. |
| **High** | Won't install or build, import crashes, a core API is broken | Yank + superseding release + a CHANGELOG entry and release-note callout. |
| **Low** | Cosmetic, docs-only, a minor non-blocking bug | **Do not yank.** Fix forward in the next normal release. |

### When we publish a security advisory (GHSA)

We open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/raeq/translit/security/advisories)
**only** when the issue is **trivially exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker
remotely** — that is, through untrusted text input, which is translit's exact use case
(cleaning untrusted text). A bug that requires local access or credentials is still
yanked and fixed forward, but it does not warrant a GHSA. A CVE flows from the GHSA when
one is opened; link it from the yank reason. For private reporting of suspected issues,
see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Per-registry mechanism

translit ships to several ecosystems; the "yank" verb differs in each. The current
artifact is PyPI; the rest arrive with the `0.8` `translit-core` bindings.

| Artifact | Mechanism | Destructive? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **PyPI** (`translit-rs`) | Yank (PEP 592), with a reason | No — reversible | pip skips it unless someone pins `==`. Never use "Delete release". |
| **crates.io** | `cargo yank --version X` (`--undo` to reverse) | No | Existing `Cargo.lock` still resolves; new dependents blocked. |
| **npm** | `npm deprecate pkg@X "msg"` | No | `unpublish` is only allowed <72h or with no dependents — do not rely on it. |
| **Go** (`pkg.go.dev`) | `retract` directive in `go.mod`, shipped in the next tag | No | The module proxy is immutable; you retract by releasing forward. |
| **RubyGems** | `gem yank -v X` | Pulls from index | More aggressive than PyPI; still cannot re-push the number. |
| **Maven Central** | None — cannot yank or delete | Immutable | Only remedy: publish a fixed version and document it (optional POM relocation). |
| **CRAN** | Submit a corrected version | Old version archived | CRAN archives the superseded release. |

### Communication (every tier ≥ High)

- Prepend `⚠️ YANKED — do not use, see vX.Y.Z+1` to the bad GitHub Release's notes.
- Add a [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) entry under the superseding version explaining the
  fault.
- If the issue meets the GHSA bar, open the advisory and link it from the yank reasons.
- Keep the yank-reason text consistent across every registry the bad version reached.
