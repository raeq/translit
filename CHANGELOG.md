## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- `strip_control` and `strip_zero_width` now work as independent pipeline steps
  without requiring `collapse_whitespace=True`. Previously they were silently
  ignored when `collapse_whitespace` was disabled.
- `strip_control_chars()` and `strip_zero_width_chars()` standalone Rust
  functions for filtering without whitespace collapsing.
- `decimal` and `hexadecimal` flags in `SlugConfig` are now functional. Setting
  `decimal=False` preserves `&#NNN;` entities; `hexadecimal=False` preserves
  `&#xHHH;` entities. Previously these flags were accepted but silently ignored.
- Rust integration tests: `tests/integration_emoji.rs` (10 tests),
  `tests/integration_slugify.rs` (20 tests),
  `tests/integration_transliterate.rs` (21 tests),
  `tests/integration_whitespace.rs` (12 tests).

### Changed
- `TextPipeline` parameters `strip_control` and `strip_zero_width` changed from
  `bool` (default `True`) to `bool | None` (default `None`). When `None`, they
  inherit from `collapse_whitespace` — `True` if `collapse_whitespace=True`,
  `False` otherwise. Set explicitly to `True` for standalone use without
  `collapse_whitespace`. This is backward compatible: existing code that passes
  `collapse_whitespace=True` gets the same behavior as before.
- `steps()` now reports `strip_control` and `strip_zero_width` as separate
  entries when active, giving full visibility into pipeline behavior.
- Pipeline step order updated: `normalize → confusables → demojize →
  strip_accents → transliterate → fold_case → strip_control →
  strip_zero_width → collapse_whitespace`.
- Migrated from `once_cell` to `std::sync::LazyLock` / `OnceLock`; MSRV bumped
  to 1.80. Removed `once_cell` dependency.
- `needs_cjk_space()` match arm tightened from wildcard `_` to explicit
  `Ideograph | Hangul | Kana` to match the call-site `is_cjk` guard.

### Fixed
- `decode_entities()` corrupting multi-byte UTF-8 characters (BUG-1). The
  function used `bytes[i] as char` which treated each continuation byte as a
  separate Latin-1 codepoint (e.g. `café` → `cafÃ©`). Now advances by full
  UTF-8 characters.
- `decode_numeric_entity_skip()` panicking on malformed `&#` followed by
  multi-byte UTF-8 (BUG-2). The skip function walked through continuation
  bytes looking for `;`, landing inside a multi-byte character. Now stops at
  the first non-ASCII byte.

### Performance
- ASCII fast-path in `demojize_impl` and `demojize_rust`: pure-ASCII text
  returns immediately without `Vec<char>` allocation or emoji scanning.
- `filter_stopwords` replaced intermediate `Vec<_>` + `.join()` with a
  pre-allocated `String` fold, removing one allocation per slugify call.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- Python 3.14 support (classifier and CI test matrix).
- `ruff check --fix` pre-commit hook for automatic lint fixing.
- CI publish workflow using `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` with OIDC trusted publishers.
- Multi-platform wheel builds: Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (Intel, ARM64), Windows.
- `steps()` method on `_TextPipeline` type stub.

### Changed
- Resolved all clippy pedantic warnings instead of suppressing them — reduced
  lint suppressions from 48 to 22 (remaining are genuine PyO3 constraints).
  Fixes include: combined identical match arms, replaced manual counters with
  `.enumerate()`, moved item declarations before statements, used `clone_into()`,
  merged identical branches, fixed doc comment formatting.
- Widened `stopwords` and `replacements` type stubs from strict `tuple`/`list`
  to `Sequence` for better mypy compatibility.
- Applied `ruff format` to all Python source and test files.
- Switched docs publish from deprecated `maturin upload` to
  `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`.
- macOS Intel wheels now cross-compiled on ARM64 runner (macos-14) instead of
  deprecated macos-13.
- CI doctests now run against installed package (not source tree) with explicit
  `shell: bash` for Windows compatibility.

### Fixed
- `TextPipeline.explain()` doctest: output format is `normalize (NFC)` not
  `normalize (form=NFC)`.
- `from __future__ import annotations` placement in test files (must follow
  module docstring, not precede it).
- Malformed HTML entity test expectation: `decode_entities("&#xyz;")` correctly
  returns `""`, not `"yz;"`.
- Rust benchmark CI: target `bench_core` binary explicitly to avoid passing
  Criterion flags to the test harness.
- Ruff lint fixes: unsorted imports in `test_encoding.py`, unused import
  `is_mixed_script` in `test_security_invariants.py`.
- Read the Docs trigger workflow: simplified curl status handling, graceful
  warning when `RTD_TOKEN` is missing.
- Removed incorrect PyPy classifier (abi3 is CPython-only).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- `src/unicode_ranges.rs` — named constants for all Unicode codepoint ranges used
  by the library, eliminating magic numbers scattered across modules.
- `tests/test_concurrency.py` — concurrent access tests for `LANG_TABLES` and
  `HANGUL_CACHE`, plus malformed Unicode input tests.
- Code coverage reporting in CI (`pytest-cov`, XML report uploaded as artifact).
- `CLOCK$`, `KEYBD$`, `SCREEN$`, `COM0`, `LPT0` added to Windows reserved filename list.
- `casefold()` alias for `fold_case()` — matches `str.casefold()` naming.
- `remove_accents()` alias for `strip_accents()` — matches sklearn/ML ecosystem naming.
- Compatibility parameter aliases: `replacement_text`/`max_len` on `sanitize_filename()`
  (pathvalidate), `greedy`/`preferred_aliases` on `is_confusable()` (confusable_homoglyphs),
  `delimiters` on `demojize()` (emoji library).
- Data Engineer persona guide (`docs/data-engineer-guide.md`) — ETL normalization,
  deduplication, batch processing, pandas/PySpark/Airflow integration patterns.
- Complete API documentation for 19 previously undocumented exported functions:
  precompiled pipelines, grapheme clusters, encoding detection, `Text` builder,
  `is_safe_hostname`, `demojize`, `strip_bidi`, `EmojiProvider` protocol.
- Three new API reference pages: Precompiled Pipelines, Grapheme Clusters, Encoding.
- "Guides by role" section in `docs/index.md` and `README.md`.
- Performance section in `README.md` with benchmark numbers.
- `Script` enum documentation expanded from 28 to all 41 members.

### Changed
- `transliterate_impl` refactored: capacity estimation extracted to `estimate_capacity()`,
  character classification to `classify_char()`, and CJK spacing logic to
  `needs_cjk_space()`.
- All `RwLock` accesses now recover from lock poisoning using
  `.unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())` instead of silently falling through.
- Lambda closures in `_compat.py` replaced with named inner functions for clarity.
- `emoji.rs` `write!()` call no longer uses `.unwrap()` (infallible, documented with
  a `// SAFETY` comment).
- MkDocs theme switched from `material` to `readthedocs`.
- All documentation references updated from "unirust" to "translit".
- Development status promoted from Alpha to Beta.
- Package renamed from `translit` to `translit-rs` on PyPI (interim until PEP 541
  grants the `translit` name). Python import remains `import translit`.

### Fixed
- Type stub `_text.pyi` imported from wrong module name (`unirust` → `translit`).
- Type stub `_translit.pyi` missing `min_confidence` parameter on `_decode_to_utf8`.
- Type stub `_text.pyi` missing `grapheme_split`, `grapheme_truncate`, `catalog_key` methods.
- `security_clean()` pipeline step order corrected in 5+ locations: strip_bidi runs
  before collapse_whitespace (matching Rust implementation).
- `catalog_key()` step order corrected: transliterate before strip_accents.
- Stale PyO3 boundary overhead corrected from ~4µs to ~240ns in docs and code comments.

### Deprecated
- `translit._compat` awesome-slugify compatibility layer (`Slugify`, `UniqueSlugify`,
  `slugify_*` instances) — planned removal in v1.0.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-01-01

### Added
- Initial release.
- Unicode transliteration for 56 language profiles.
- Slugification, normalization, confusable detection, filename sanitization.
- Emoji demojization with ZWJ sequence support.
- Backward-compatible layers for Unidecode and awesome-slugify.
