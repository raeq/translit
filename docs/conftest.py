"""Sybil doc-test harness for the cookbook (#154).

Every fenced ``python`` block in the Markdown files under ``docs/`` is executed
against the **installed** ``disarm`` wheel, and any ``assert`` it contains is
checked. This is what keeps published recipes from rotting: a wrong claim or a
broken snippet turns the test suite red, gated alongside the existing tiers.

Authoring rules for recipes (see CONTRIBUTING.md → "Doc-test recipes"):

* Assert outputs, never decorate them with ``# =>`` comments.
* Use the **public API only** — reaching into internals is itself a doc bug.
* A document shares one namespace top-to-bottom, so import once and reuse.
* Hide setup/teardown in ``<!--- invisible-code-block: python ... -->`` blocks.
* Skip a block that is intentionally not runnable with ``<!--- skip: next -->``.

    Defensive hygiene for in-process runs. Full cross-page isolation (needed
