# Language Detection

How translit's `lang="auto"` detection works, from script identification through character-level discrimination to fail-safe fallbacks.

## Overview

When `lang="auto"` is passed to `transliterate()`, `slugify()`, `catalog_key()`, or any other function that accepts a `lang` parameter, translit runs a three-stage detection pipeline:

1. **Script identification** — find the dominant non-Latin, non-Common script
2. **Character-level discrimination** — scan for exclusive characters that uniquely identify a language within ambiguous scripts
3. **Fallback** — use the script's default language mapping

The entire pipeline is deterministic, O(n), and fail-safe: if detection is uncertain, it falls back to the safe default rather than guessing.

```python
from translit import transliterate

# Stage 1: Cyrillic detected → ambiguous script
# Stage 2: ї found → Ukrainian discriminator hit
# Stage 3: returns "uk"
transliterate("Київ", lang="auto")   # → "Kyiv" (Ukrainian profile)
```

---

## Stage 1: Script Identification

translit classifies each character by its Unicode script property using a static table of 42 scripts with binary search lookup. The first non-Latin, non-Common, non-Inherited character determines the **primary script**.

```python
from translit import detect_scripts

detect_scripts("Москва")      # → [Script.CYRILLIC]
detect_scripts("東京タワー")   # → [Script.HAN, Script.KATAKANA]
detect_scripts("Hello World")  # → [Script.LATIN]
```

For Latin-only text, no language override is applied (stage 2 may still detect Latin discriminators like Vietnamese or Turkish characters).

### Unambiguous scripts

Many scripts map to exactly one language in translit's profile set. Detection is immediate with no further analysis needed:

| Script | Language | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Georgian | Georgian | `ka` |
| Armenian | Armenian | `hy` |
| Thai | Thai | `th` |
| Hangul | Korean | `ko` |
| Hiragana / Katakana | Japanese | `ja` |
| Greek | Greek | `el` |
| Thaana | Dhivehi | `dv` |
| Bengali | Bengali | `bn` |
| Tamil | Tamil | `ta` |
| Telugu | Telugu | `te` |
| Kannada | Kannada | `kn` |
| Malayalam | Malayalam | `ml` |
| Gujarati | Gujarati | `gu` |
| Gurmukhi | Punjabi | `pa` |
| Odia | Odia | `or` |
| Sinhala | Sinhala | `si` |
| Ethiopic | Amharic | `am` |
| Tibetan | Tibetan | `bo` |
| Lao | Lao | `lo` |
| Myanmar | Burmese | `my` |
| Khmer | Khmer | `km` |
| Hebrew | Hebrew | `he` |
| Javanese | Javanese | `jv` |

For these scripts, `lang="auto"` is equivalent to passing the explicit code.

### Ambiguous scripts

Three scripts are shared by multiple languages in translit's profile set:

| Script | Languages | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Cyrillic** | Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Mongolian | `ru` |
| **Arabic** | Arabic, Persian | `ar` |
| **Latin** | German, Turkish, Vietnamese, + 20 others | *(no override)* |

These proceed to stage 2.

## Stage 2: Character-Level Discrimination

For ambiguous scripts, translit scans up to the first **2,000 characters** looking for **exclusive characters** — codepoints that appear in exactly one language's alphabet among all supported profiles for that script.

### Discriminator table

| Script | Exclusive characters | Detected language |
|---|---|---|
| Cyrillic | ґ Ґ ї Ї є Є і І | `uk` (Ukrainian) |
| Cyrillic | ђ Ђ ћ Ћ љ Љ њ Њ џ Џ ј Ј | `sr` (Serbian) |
| Cyrillic | ө Ө ү Ү | `mn` (Mongolian) |
| Arabic | پ چ ژ گ | `fa` (Persian) |
| Latin | ơ Ơ ư Ư | `vi` (Vietnamese) |
| Latin | İ ı | `tr` (Turkish) |
| Latin | ß ẞ | `de` (German) |

### Algorithm

```
for each character in text[0..2000]:
    if character is an exclusive discriminator for this script:
        return the associated language  ← first hit wins, bail early
return None  ← no discriminator found, use default
```

Key properties:

- **First-hit-wins**: scanning stops at the first discriminator character found. This is a performance optimization — for well-formed text, a single exclusive character is sufficient for identification.
- **2,000-character cap**: avoids scanning entire documents. The first 2K characters are sufficient for discrimination in practice.
- **No conflict resolution**: if a text contains exclusive characters from two different languages (e.g., Ukrainian ї and Serbian ћ), whichever appears first wins. This is intentional — such mixed text is rare and artificial.

### Examples

```python
from translit import transliterate

# Ukrainian: ї is exclusive to Ukrainian Cyrillic
transliterate("Київ", lang="auto")          # → "Kyiv"

# Serbian: ћ is exclusive to Serbian Cyrillic
transliterate("Београд", lang="auto")       # → "Beograd"

# Persian: پ is exclusive to Persian Arabic
transliterate("پارسی", lang="auto")         # → "parsy"

# Vietnamese: ơ is exclusive to Vietnamese Latin
transliterate("Hà Nội", lang="auto")        # → uses vi profile

# German: ß is exclusive to German Latin
transliterate("Straße", lang="auto")        # → "Strasse" (de: ß→ss)

# No discriminator: Москва has no exclusive chars
transliterate("Москва", lang="auto")        # → "Moskva" (default ru)
```

---

## Stage 3: Fallback

If no discriminator is found:

- **Ambiguous scripts** fall back to their default language: Cyrillic → `ru`, Arabic → `ar`, Han → `zh`, Devanagari → `hi`
- **Latin-only text** receives no language override (default transliteration table)
- **Non-Latin Latin-discriminator text**: if the text contains only Latin characters but includes discriminators (ơ, İ, ß), the Latin discriminator table is consulted

---

## Fail-Safe Guarantee

The discriminator system is designed to **never produce a worse result** than the previous script-default approach:

1. Discriminators can only **upgrade** detection (from script default to a more specific language)
2. If no discriminator is found, the result is identical to not using `lang="auto"` at all
3. Discriminator characters are selected to have **zero ambiguity** — each appears in exactly one supported language profile for its script

This means `lang="auto"` is always at least as good as the script default, and often better.

---

## Limitations

- **Bulgarian vs Russian**: Bulgarian Cyrillic uses the same character set as Russian (no exclusive characters). `lang="auto"` defaults to `ru` for both. Pass `lang="bg"` explicitly for Bulgarian text.
- **Mongolian Cyrillic vs Russian**: Mongolian is detected only when ө or ү appear. Standard Russian characters in Mongolian text are not distinguished.
- **Devanagari languages**: Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and Sanskrit all use Devanagari. `lang="auto"` defaults to `hi` for all. Since the default Devanagari transliteration table is used by all four, this has no practical impact.
- **Han characters**: Chinese and Japanese kanji share the same Unicode block. `lang="auto"` defaults to `zh` (Chinese pinyin). For Japanese readings, pass `lang="ja"` explicitly.
- **Mixed-script text**: when text contains multiple scripts (e.g., "Hello Мир"), the first non-Latin, non-Common script determines the language. Latin portions use the default table regardless.
- **Short text**: very short strings (1-3 characters) may not contain any discriminator characters, falling back to the script default.

## Integration with Pipelines

`lang="auto"` works with all translit entry points:

```python
from translit import (
    transliterate, slugify, catalog_key, search_key, sort_key,
    TextPipeline, Slugifier, Text, LANG_AUTO,
)

# Functions
transliterate("Київ", lang="auto")
catalog_key("Москва", lang="auto")
search_key("Straße", lang="auto")
sort_key("Війна і мир", lang="auto")

# Classes
pipe = TextPipeline(transliterate=True, lang="auto")
slug = Slugifier(lang="auto")

# Text builder
Text("Київ").transliterate(lang="auto").value

# Type-safe constant
transliterate("Москва", lang=LANG_AUTO)
```
