# Filename Sanitization

`sanitize_filename()` converts arbitrary Unicode strings into safe filenames that work across operating systems. It handles transliteration, illegal character removal, reserved name detection, and length truncation.

!!! note "These examples are executed in CI"
    Every `python` block on this page runs against the shipped wheel and its
    asserted outputs are checked, so the results below cannot silently rot
    (see #154). Each `assert` is the guaranteed return value.

## Basic usage

```python
from disarm import sanitize_filename

assert sanitize_filename("my<file>:v2.txt") == "my_file_v2.txt"
assert sanitize_filename("café résumé.pdf") == "cafe_resume.pdf"
assert sanitize_filename("../../../etc/passwd") == "_.etcpasswd"
assert sanitize_filename("CON.txt") == "_CON.txt"  # Windows reserved name
```

## Parameters

### separator

Character used to replace illegal characters (default: `"_"`):

```python
assert sanitize_filename("hello:world", separator="-") == "hello-world"
```

### max_length

Maximum filename length in bytes (default: `255`):

```python
assert len(sanitize_filename("a" * 300)) == 255
```

When `preserve_extension=True`, the extension is counted toward the limit and preserved:

```python
assert sanitize_filename("a" * 300 + ".pdf", max_length=20) == "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.pdf"
```

### platform

Target platform for sanitization rules:

```python
# Universal (default) — safe on all platforms
assert sanitize_filename("my:file?.txt", platform="universal") == "my_file.txt"

# POSIX — only / and NUL are illegal
assert sanitize_filename("my:file?.txt", platform="posix") == "my:file?.txt"

# Windows — additionally forbids < > : " | ? * and reserved names
assert sanitize_filename("CON.txt", platform="windows") == "_CON.txt"
```

| Platform | Illegal characters | Reserved names |
|---|---|---|
| `"universal"` | Union of POSIX + Windows rules | CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1–9, LPT1–9 |
| `"posix"` | `/`, NUL | None |
| `"windows"` | `< > : " / \\ \| ? *`, control chars | CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1–9, LPT1–9 |

### lang

Language profile for transliteration of non-ASCII characters:

```python
# German profile expands umlauts (ä → ae)
assert sanitize_filename("Ärger.txt", lang="de") == "Aerger.txt"

# Default profile strips the diaeresis (ä → a)
assert sanitize_filename("Ärger.txt") == "Arger.txt"
```

### preserve_extension

Whether to preserve the file extension during truncation (default: `True`):

```python
assert sanitize_filename("long_name.pdf", max_length=12, preserve_extension=True) == "long_nam.pdf"
assert sanitize_filename("long_name.pdf", max_length=12, preserve_extension=False) == "long_name.pd"
```

## Pipeline

The sanitization pipeline executes in this order:

1. Transliterate non-ASCII characters (using `lang` if set)
2. Strip OS-illegal characters (per `platform`)
3. Replace stripped characters with `separator`
4. Collapse consecutive separators
5. Handle reserved names (prefix with `_`)
6. Truncate to `max_length` (respecting `preserve_extension`)
7. Strip leading/trailing separators and dots
