# Architecture: Performance

The optimization strategies that make translit 10–53× faster than pure-Python alternatives.

## The PyO3 boundary problem

Every call from Python into Rust crosses the PyO3 boundary: argument conversion, GIL management, result conversion back to a Python object. This costs ~300–500 ns per call. For a function like `transliterate()` that processes a short string in ~60 ns of actual Rust work, the boundary overhead is the dominant cost. Every optimization strategy below either reduces the time spent in the boundary or reduces the number of crossings.

## Optimization 1: Python-side ASCII fast-path

The most effective optimization is never crossing the boundary at all. `transliterate()`, `strip_accents()`, and `normalize()` check `text.isascii()` on the Python side before calling into Rust. This is a ~30–50 ns CPython C call that scans the string's internal buffer. Pure-ASCII strings (the common case in English workloads) return immediately:

| Function | With fast-path | Without |
|---|---|---|
| `transliterate("hello")` | 62 ns | 407 ns |
| `strip_accents("hello")` | 36 ns | 805 ns |

This turns the common case from a ~400 ns function call into a ~60 ns no-op.

## Optimization 2: Flat BMP array

The default transliteration table covers U+0080–U+FFFF as a flat `[Option<&'static str>; 65408]` array indexed by `(codepoint - 0x80)`. Lookup is a bounds check and an array dereference — no hashing, no collision chain, no cache-unfriendly pointer chasing.

The array occupies ~512 KB in the `.rodata` section. The OS pages it in on demand; only the pages containing accessed codepoint ranges are resident in memory.

This replaced a PHF map for BMP lookups and delivered the single largest speedup: Latin transliteration went from 34× faster than Unidecode to 38× faster.

## Optimization 3: Range-based dispatch

Before consulting the flat BMP array, `lookup_default()` dispatches by codepoint range to dedicated handlers:

- CJK Unified Ideographs → Hanzi pinyin PHF table
- Hangul syllables and compatibility jamo → algorithmic romanization

This avoids probing the 65K-entry array for scripts that have their own higher-quality tables. It also means the flat array doesn't need entries for CJK/Hangul ranges, keeping it focused on Latin/Cyrillic/Arabic/Greek and other BMP scripts.

## Optimization 4: Cow<'a, str> return

`transliterate_impl()` returns `Cow<'a, str>`. When the input is pure ASCII (detected via `str::is_ascii()`), it returns `Borrowed` — a pointer to the input with no allocation. Non-ASCII input returns `Owned` with a pre-sized buffer. The Cow type is transparent to callers and avoids the cost of cloning strings that don't need modification.

## Optimization 5: Capacity pre-sizing

The output buffer is pre-sized based on the first non-ASCII character's script:

- CJK/Hangul/kana: **4×** input byte length (each character expands to a multi-letter syllable plus space)
- Everything else: **1×** input byte length (most characters map 1:1)

This heuristic eliminates reallocations for the two most common workload shapes. The cost of over-sizing (a few KB of unused capacity) is negligible compared to the cost of repeated reallocations that memcpy the entire buffer.

## Optimization 6: List input (batch processing)

`transliterate()`, `slugify()`, `normalize()`, and `strip_accents()` accept a `list[str]` and process all strings in a single PyO3 boundary crossing. For 100 strings, this saves ~24 µs of boundary overhead (240 ns × 100). The saving scales linearly with list size.

| Operation (100 strings) | List | Loop | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| transliterate | 28.3 µs | 82.9 µs | 2.9× |

## Optimization 7: Consistent Rust-native normalization

`normalize()` uses the Rust `unicode-normalization` crate (Unicode 16.0) for
all non-ASCII inputs — non-ASCII single strings, all list inputs, and
pipelines. Pure-ASCII single strings take the Python-side `isascii()` fast-path
from Optimization 1 and never enter Rust (ASCII is invariant under all four
normalization forms). For everything else this ensures consistent results
across code paths and eliminates Unicode version mismatches between CPython's
`unicodedata` (Unicode 15.1) and the Rust crate's tables.

While CPython's `unicodedata.normalize()` is faster for single-string calls
(it operates directly on PEP 393 compact strings with zero-copy semantics),
the correctness tradeoff is worth the performance cost: using a single
Unicode version prevents subtle bugs where different code paths produce
different results for codepoints assigned between Unicode versions.

## Optimization 8: PHF for specialized data

All secondary lookup tables (Hanzi pinyin, confusables, case folding, emoji) use compile-time perfect hash functions via `phf_codegen`. PHF provides O(1) lookup with no runtime allocation, no collision handling, and deterministic performance. The tables are generated at build time by `build.rs` and embedded as static data.

## What translit does NOT optimize

Two operations are inherently slower than their CPython C-builtin counterparts:

- **Normalization**: `unicodedata.normalize()` operates on CPython's internal string buffer without copying. translit uses Rust for all normalization (consistency over speed — see Optimization 7).
- **Case folding**: `str.casefold()` is a CPython C builtin with zero allocation overhead. translit's PHF-based `fold_case()` is within ~4× at the Python level, with the gap dominated by PyO3 boundary-crossing cost rather than algorithmic differences.

These gaps are acceptable because normalization and case folding are rarely the bottleneck in real workloads — transliteration and slugification dominate processing time, and translit is 7–38× faster for those.
